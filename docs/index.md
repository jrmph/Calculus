# Calculus Reviewer

Welcome to the **Calculus Reviewer**, a comprehensive guide created by **Jhames Rhonnielle Martin**, an 18-year-old BSIS student. This resource is designed to help you master calculus from the ground up, offering clear explanations, intuitive examples, and step-by-step problem-solving techniques tailored for students at all levels.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Foundations**: Review of functions, domains, ranges, and prerequisite knowledge.
- **Limits & Continuity**: Core concepts that form the foundation of calculus.
- **Derivatives**: Rules, techniques, and practical applications of differentiation.
- **Integration**: Methods and applications for definite and indefinite integrals.
- **Advanced Topics**: Series, multivariable calculus, and differential equations.
- **Problem-Solving**: Strategies, common mistakes to avoid, and practice problems.

## How to Use This Guide

This guide is organized sequentially, following a typical calculus learning path. If you're new to calculus, start with the [Foundations](/foundations/functions) section and progress through each topic in order.

For those reviewing specific concepts, use the navigation menu to jump to topics of interest.

Each section includes:
- **Conceptual Explanations**: Intuitive breakdowns to build understanding.
- **Visual Representations**: Diagrams and graphs to clarify abstract concepts.
- **Worked Examples**: Step-by-step solutions to real problems.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Tips to avoid frequent errors.
- **Practice Problems**: Exercises with detailed solutions to reinforce learning.
