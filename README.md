**A Comprehensive Guide to Calculus**  
Created by Jhames Rhonnielle Martin, an 18-year-old BSIS student

Welcome to the **Calculus Reviewer**, a student-friendly resource designed to simplify calculus for learners at all levels. This project offers clear explanations, step-by-step solutions, and practical examples to help you master calculus concepts, from foundational topics to advanced applications.

## Features

- **üìö Complete Coverage**  
  In-depth content spanning all key calculus topics, from basics to advanced concepts.

- **üßÆ Clear Examples**  
  Each concept is explained with intuitive examples and detailed solutions.

- **üîç Deep Understanding**  
  Emphasis on building intuition and conceptual clarity, not just memorizing formulas.

- **üìù Practice Problems**  
  Numerous exercises with solutions to reinforce learning and build confidence.

## What's Included

This guide is structured to follow a logical learning path:

- **Foundations**: Functions, domains, ranges, and prerequisite concepts.
- **Limits & Continuity**: Core principles of calculus.
- **Derivatives**: Differentiation rules, techniques, and real-world applications.
- **Integration**: Methods for definite and indefinite integrals.
- **Advanced Topics**: Series, multivariable calculus, and differential equations.
- **Problem-Solving**: Strategies, common pitfalls, and practice problems.

Each section includes:
- Conceptual explanations for intuitive understanding.
